# Sitefinity Custom Widget
## Overview
In the following repository I have posted a piece of code which I have made during my internship at Progress Software, Sofia. The base idea is that I am using a running instance of Sitefinity CMS in which I have created a custom widget which consumes the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and shows the users specifically selected information from the API.

## Prerequisites
To use the custom widget, you need to build the source code of Sitefinity CMS. Make sure that your development system meets the following minimal requirements:

* A valid Sitefinity CMS license.
* Sitefinity CMS 14.1 or later.
* Your setup must comply with the minimum system requirements. For more information, see the System requirements for the Sitefinity CMS version you are using.
* Visual Studio 2015 or later.
