# Sitefinity Custom Widget
## Overview
In the following repository I have posted a piece of code which I have made during my internship at Progress Software, Sofia. The base idea is that I am using a running instance of Sitefinity CMS in which I have created a custom widget which consumes the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and shows the users specifically selected information from the API.
